## Abstract

Eucalypts are key tree species in most Australian ecosystems. Grassy woodland Eucalypts are predominantly from the section Adnataria, a group of ~100 species that diverged approx. 10Mya. Using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, we re- sequenced the genomes of 600 individuals across 14 Eucalyptus species from section Adnataria. This poster presents preliminary results of the study. We confirmed previous findings of very high genetic diversity, and found little genome-wide divergence between species. We also found signals of ongoing inter-species gene flow and discovered many cryptic hybrids. We found only weak signs of population structure, and varying extents of genome-wide isolation by landscape among species.
